#
# signify verbose mode, true turns on verbose output
# ex: verbose = true|false
#
verbose = true

#
# HTTP protocol.  Options HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0.
# Some webservers have broken implementation of the
# 1.1 protocol which skews throughput evaluations.
# If you notice some scout clients hanging for
# extended periods of time, change this to HTTP/1.0
# ex: protocol = HTTP/1.1
#     protocol = HTTP/1.0
#
protocol = HTTP/1.1

#
# connection timeout value. Set the value in seconds for
# socket connection timeouts. The default value is 30 seconds.
# You might want to increased that number under heavy load.
# ex: timeout = 30
#
# timeout = 

#
# show-codes: if true, this directive tells scout to write
# the return codes to the urls.txt file. This is handy for 
# server trouble-shooting, link checking, etc. By default 
# this value is set to false.
# ex: show-codes = false
#
# show-codes = 

#
# images: if true, this directive tells scout to parse the
# <img src=...> tag, check the integrity of the image link
# and add the image to the urls.txt file. The default value
# is false.
# ex: image = false
#
# images = 

#
# set the scout User-Agent to identify yourself.
# ex: user-agent = Limey The Bulldog
#
# user-agent =

#
# WWW-Authenticate login. When scout hits a webpage
# that requires basic authentication, it will search
# it's logins for authentication which matches the 
# specific realm requested by the server. If it finds 
# a match, it will send that login information. If it
# fails to match the realm, it will send the default
# login information. (Default is "all"). You may 
# configure scout with several logins as long as no
# two realms match. The format for logins is:
# username:password[:realm] where "realm" is optional.
# If you do not supply a realm, then it will default
# to "all"
# ex: login = jdfulmer:whoohoo:Admin
#     login = jeff:haha
# 
# login = 

#
# WWW-Authenticate username and password.  When scout
# hits a webpage that requires authentication, it will
# send this user name and password to the server.  Note
# this is NOT form based authentication.  You will have
# to construct URLs for that.
# THIS IS DEPRECATED use: login = username:password
#
# ex: username = jdfulmer
#     password = whoohoo
#
# username =
# password = 

#
# Proxy protocol. This option allows you to select a proxy
# server stress testing. The proxy will request the URL(s)
# specified by -u"my.url.org" OR from the urls.txt file.
#
# ex: proxy-host = proxy.whoohoo.org
#     proxy-port = 8080
#
# proxy-host =
# proxy-port = 

#
# Proxy-Authenticate. When scout hits a proxy server which
# requires username and password authentication, it will this
# username and password to the server. The format is username,
# password and optional realm each separated by a colon. You
# may enter more than one proxy-login as long as each one has
# a different realm. If you do not enter a realm, then scout 
# will send that login information to all proxy challenges. If
# you have more than one proxy-login, then scout will attempt
# to match the login to the realm.
# ex: proxy-login: jeff:secret:corporate
#     proxy-login: jeff:whoohoo
#
# proxy-login =
